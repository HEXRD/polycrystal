# polycrystal

This is a package with microstructural models for polycrystalline materials.  It contains subpackages for crystal orientations, microstructure (in the sense of grain/phase assignment), linear anisotropic elasticty and slip modeling. A primary intent has been to use this package to provide material properties for finite element simulations using the companion package, _polycrystalx_.

There is some overlap with HEXRD in representation of rotation matrices and crystal symmetries.
